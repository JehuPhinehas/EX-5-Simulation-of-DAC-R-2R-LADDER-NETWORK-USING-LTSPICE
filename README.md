## 5.SIMULATION OF DAC CONVERTER ( R-2R NETWORK)  USING LT- SPICE
            
**DATE:**  


## AIM  : To simulate the performance of R-2R  circuits using LT- SPICE                

---

## PROCEDURE:
1.Double click on LT- SPICE  icon
2.New schematic window open
3.Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .
4.Complete the connection.
5.Save the file by giving file name.
6.Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude-> time delay stop time value.
7.Click on the run option ->simulationwindow opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained
